I like to combine experimental and computational approaches to get the best of both worlds.\nBy training, I am an immunologist and not a developmental biologist nor bioinformatician. That means I am learning a ton of new things every day. In this blog, I try to explain biological and computational concepts to better understand them. With that, I would like to point out that everything on this website is just my own interpretation of a given topic and it is possible that it might not be 100% correct. If you notice anything like that, I would be very grateful for your feedback. I hope that this blog will be useful not only for me, but maybe for someone else as well."

    "text": "Hello, my name is Josef and this is the first post on my blog “The Waddington Code” (I will explain the name in some other post). I will try to explain why I started this project and how I did it. Let me start with my story. I was always interested in animals and nature in general. When I got accepted to Masaryk University in Brno, I started studying experimental and molecular biology. During my master’s studies, I shifted my focus more towards immunology and cell-ECM interactions. However, I felt that this wasn’t what I really wanted. After finishing my master’s degree, I started my Ph.D. in developmental biology. I have to say that this field feels right for me. However, there was one small catch – I did not have any knowledge about animal development.\nIn addition to that, I am very interested in bioinformatics and looking for patterns in various types of data. For some time I was the only “bioinformatician” in my new lab, so developmental biology was not the only thing I needed to get deeper into.\n\n\n\nDuring the last year, since I started my Ph.D. studies, I had to (and will have to) learn many new things. I found out that the most effective way to understand a topic is to explain it to other people. However, these other people do not always have time or are simply not interested in my oversimplified explanations of complex phenomena or algorithms. And here comes blog writing. I do not force anyone to read this. I am just taking notes to understand things better or keep track of ideas that I find interesting. And who knows, maybe someone will find it useful or I will get some feedback so I can improve my skills or gain more knowledge."

    "text": "Quarto\nDo you know RMarkdown? Quarto is built on that and it is basically RMarkdown on steroids. It is very easy to write multi-language scripts or create various types of documents from reports, presentations, websites, or books. What is a small difference from standard RMarkdown is that you need to install Quarto as separate software. But trust me, it is worth it. To be completely honest, I was a bit lazy to learn Quarto because RMarkdown was always sufficient for my purposes. This is the reason why I chose Quarto for my blog: to learn something new. The basic syntax is still basically pure markdown, so it is really easy to just jump in. I mentioned above that Quarto supports many types of output documents, and there is also one dedicated to blogs. The Quarto team made it very simple to use this template and they also provide a pretty straightforward tutorial. Basically, all you need to do is:\nquarto create project blog thewaddingtoncode\nAnd you are good to go. The rest is on Quarto website."

Quarto actually offers so-called Quarto Pub, which you can use to publish your blog or website. However, I decided that I would use GitHub Pages for this purpose since I always wanted to try it. There are several ways how to do it. I used a quite simple approach. First, I created a git repository that is linked to GitHub. After creating a GitHub repository and linking it with my local git repository, I went back to the terminal. At this point, you need to check that your _quarto.yml file contains the following lines:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nOnce this was done, I could run following command and push everything on github. This create docs file and render the website.\nquarto render\nThe last thing I did to publish this post (and the whole blog) was to go to my GitHub repository settings → Pages and set the deployment from a branch like this:\n\nWith this, my blog was ready to start."

However there is one small difference – design of the primers. Unlike in standard PCR, where you want just to amplify some piece of DNA, here you want to add some extra base pairs. These “overhangs” on primers has complementary sequence to the places on the vector where the insert should be placed. Not only it gives nice control of e.g. insert orientation in the final plasmid, but it has one other nice advantage. It is possible to add even more"

    "text": "Why to Choose Such a Stupid Name for a Blog?\nWhen I was thinking about starting a blog, I was looking for a fitting name (naturally). I knew that the blog will be mostly about developmental biology and bioinformatics. Trust me or not, it is not that simple. However, one concept crossed my mind – epigenetic landscape. The idea of cell commitment to its fate. This is basically one of the main pillars of modern biology and biological simulations. It was first introduced by Conrad Hal Waddington in 1950s. Name “The Waddington Code” sounded pretty cool and even intellectual so I went for it. Anyway, since I am using this name, I believe that it is appropriate to write something about C. H. Waddington and how he introduced the world to basics of epigenetics.\n\n\nAbout Mouse Tails\nSorry that I will not start with standard biography. I will not write about the childhood of C. H. Waddington or so. If you are interested in it, you are free to google that. I want to focus on the time he introduced the idea of “valleys” and “forks”.\nWaddington was really strong experimental biologist and he was determined to prove something that does not fit to classical Darwinian evolution - that the organism characteristics gained through lifetime can be inherited. Previously, in the end of 19th century, August Weissman tried the exactly the same thing. However, he was not successful and he actually demonstrated the exact opposite. This original experiment was really simple. He amputated tails in 5 generations of mice while trying to show, that the tail is getting shorter with each generation. And you guessed it correctly – he failed.\n\n\nBasics of Epigenetics\nWaddington decided to use a bit more subtle approach. He knew that drosophilla"
