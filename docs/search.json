    "text": "Hi, my name is Josef, but you can also call me Pepa. I am a Ph.D. student in Peter Fabian’s lab, where I focus on developmental processes underlying skeletal growth. I like to combine experimental and computational approaches to get the best of both worlds.\nBy training, I am an Immunologist and not developmental biologist nor bioinformatician. That means that I am learning a ton of new things every day. In this blog I try to explain biological and computational concepts to better understand it. With that I would like to point out that everything on this website is just my own interpretation of given topic and it is possible that it might not be 100 % correct. If you notice anything like that, I would be very glad for your feedback. I hope that this blog will be useful not only for me, but maybe for someone else as well."

    "text": "Hello, my name is Josef and this is first post in my blog “The Waddington Code”. I will try to explain why I started this project and how I did that. Let me start with my story. I was always interested in animals and nature in general. When I got accepted to Masaryk University in Brno, I started to study experimental and molecular biology. During my master studies I shifted my focus more towards Immunology and cell-ECM interactions. However, I felt that this is not I really want. After finishing my master degree, I started my Ph.D. in developmental biology. I have to say, that this field feels right for me. However, there was one small catch – I did not have any knowledge about animal development.\nIn addition to that, I am very interested in bioinformatics and looking for patterns in various types of data. For some time I was the only “bioinformatician” in my new lab, so the developmental biology was not the only thing I needed to get deeper in.\n\n\n\nDuring the last year, since I started my Ph.D. studies, I had to (and will have to) learn many new things. I found out that the most effective way to understand some topic is to explain it to other people. However, these other people does not always have time or are not simply interested in my oversimplified explanations of complex phenomena or algorithms. And here comes the blog writing. I do not force anyone to read this. I am just taking notes to understand things better or keep track of ideas that I find interesting. And who knows, maybe someone will find it useful or I will get some feedback so I can improve my skills or gain more knowledge."

    "text": "Concept\nIt is very easy to say: “I will just write a blog, you know.”. Well, it is not that simple. You need to do it somehow. And I really like the idea of open-source software. Which kinda limits the options. Anyway, there is quite a number of alternatives to commercial software. So my idea is to choose something that will help me even in other parts of my work."

    "text": "Quarto\nDo you know RMarkdown? Quarto is build on that and it is basically RMarkdown on steroids. It is very easy to write multi-language scripts or create various types of documents from reports, presentations, websites or books. What is a small difference from standard RMarkdown is that you need to install Quarto as a separate software. But trust me, it is wort it. To be completely honest, I was a bit lazy to learn Quarto, because RMarkdown was always sufficient for my purposes. This is the reason why I choose Quarto for my blog. To learn something new. The basic syntax is still basically pure markdown so is is really to easy to just jump in. I mentioned above, Quarto supports many types of output documents and there is also one dedicated to blogs. The Quarto team made it very simple to use this template and they also provide pretty straight forward tutorial. Basically all you need to do is:\nquarto create project blog thewaddingtoncode\nAnd you are good to go. The rest is on Quarto website."

    "text": "GitHub Pages\nQuarto is amazing for creating these markdown based documents and rendering them. However, when you are writing a blog, you also want to publish it. Quarto actually offers so called Quarto Pub which you can use to publish your blog or website. However, I decided that I will use GitHub Pages for this purspose, since I always wanted to try it. There are several ways how to do it. I used quite simple approach. First, I created a git repository that is linked to GitHub. After creating GitHub repository and linking it with my local git repository, I went back to the terminal. At this point, you need to check, that your _quarto.qmd file contains following lines:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs"
