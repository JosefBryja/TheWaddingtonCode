Hi, my name is Josef, but you can also call me Pepa. I am a Ph.D. student in Peter Fabian's lab, where I focus on developmental processes underlying skeletal growth. I like to combine experimental and computational approaches to get the best of both worlds. 

By training, I am an Immunologist and not developmental biologist nor bioinformatician. That means that I am learning a ton of new things every day. In this blog I try to explain biological and computational concepts to better understand it. With that I would like to point out that everything on this website is just my own interpretation of given topic and it is possible that it might not be 100 % correct. If you notice anything like that, I would be very glad for your feedback. I hope that this blog will be useful not only for me, but maybe for someone else as well.
